    \begin{abstract}
      The design and implementation of a server room monitoring system, which tracks significant environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and dust levels, are presented in this thesis. The system is made to give real-time updates on the circumstances in the server room, ensuring that the servers and other equipment are working properly.\\
In order to retrieve data from the database and return it in a format that the front-end can use, Node.js was used to build a REST API for the back-end. We used Prisma and PostgreSQL to provide the necessary data management and storage features. The efficient and scalable handling of massive amounts of data is ensured by the use of Node.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL, and the type-safe API offered by Prisma makes it simpler to retrieve and manipulate the data.
\\
An interface that provides real-time updates on the circumstances in the server room was made for the front-end using React, Next.js, and Tailwind. While Next.js offers server-side rendering and enhanced performance, React offers a robust and adaptable framework for creating user interfaces. Rapid and effective front-end development is made possible by Tailwind's selection of pre-made UI elements and styling tools.
