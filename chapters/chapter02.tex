\section{Introduction}
    In this implementation, in order to demonstrate how the monitoring system works instead of using actual sensors, a data generator has been used and it simulates reading of sensors (such as humidity, temperature and electricity).

\section{Methodology}
A data generator should have a random yet realistic pattern for effective system testing, so just using a simple random number would be insufficient. Therefore, in this thesis a controlled version of choosing a random number was used to mimic some parts of real-world criteria and avoid sudden changes. The methodology for this process can be seen in the accompanying flowchart .
