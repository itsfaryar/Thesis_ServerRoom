    \begin{abstract}
      This thesis presents the design and implementation of a server room monitoring system, aimed at tracking important environment variables such as temperature, humidity, and dust levels. The system is designed to provide real-time updates on the conditions within the server room, ensuring the proper functioning of the servers and other equipment.\\

      For testing purposes a data generating system has been implemented in order to mimic the behavior pattern of an actual sensor. The data is then processed and stored using a backend system built with Node.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. This allows for efficient data management and analysis, enabling the system to quickly identify any issues and provide insight into the server room's overall performance. The data is also visualized using a user panel that has been implemented using React, Next.js, and Tailwind. The panel provides users with easy-to-understand visualizations of the data, allowing for quick identification of trends and patterns.\\
      
      Overall, the monitoring system developed in this thesis provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring server room environments, with the potential to enhance performance, increase reliability, and reduce downtime. The system allows for the continuous tracking and analysis of critical environmental variables, providing users with valuable insight into the server room's overall performance. The visualizations provided by the user panel allow for quick identification of trends and patterns, enabling users to quickly identify and address any issues that may arise.\\
